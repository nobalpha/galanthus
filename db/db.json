The Digital\nEcosystem was then measured experimentally through simulations, with measures\noriginating from theoretical ecology, evaluating its likeness to biological\necosystems.

Evidence shows, however, that software ecosystems\nco-evolve independently with other software ecosystems. In other words,\nunderstanding the evolution of a software ecosystem requires an especially\nastute awareness of its competitive landscape and much consideration for other\nsoftware ecosystems in related markets. A software ecosystem does not evolve in\ninsulation but with other software ecosystems. In this research, we analyzed\nthe OpenStack software ecosystem with a focal perspective that attempted to\nunderstand its evolution as a function of other software ecosystems. We\nattempted to understand and explain the evolution of OpenStack in relation to\nother software ecosystems in the cloud computing market. Our findings add to\ntheoretical knowledge in software ecosystems by identifying and discussing\nseven different mechanisms by which software ecosystems mutually influence each\nother: sedimentation and embeddedness of business relationships, strategic\nmanagement of the portfolio of business relationships, firms values and\nreputation as a partner, core technological architecture, design of the APIs,\ncompetitive replication of functionality and multi-homing. Research addressing\nthe evolution of software ecosystem should, therefore, acknowledge that\nsoftware ecosystems entangle with other software ecosystems in multiple ways,\neven with competing ones.

An external\nobserver can choose any ecosystem property as being important. In contrast, two\necosystems are equivalent from the point of view of the organisms they contain\nif and only if for each species, the proportional population growth rate does\nnot differ between the ecosystems. Comparative studies of ecosystems should\ntherefore focus on patterns in proportional population growth rates, rather\nthan patterns in other properties such as relative abundances. Popular\nactivities such as measuring dissimilarity, and representing dissimilarity via\nordination, can then be done from the point of view of the organisms in\necosystems. Summarizing the state of an ecosystem under this approach remains\nchallenging. In general, the dynamics on equivalence classes of ecosystems\ndefined in this way are structurally different from the dynamics of ecosystems\nas seen by an external observer.

We prove that both the biodiversity\neffect and its statistical decomposition into selection and complementarity are\nfundamentally flawed because these methods use a na\\\"ive null expectation based\non neutrality, likely leading to an overestimate of the net biodiversity\neffect, and they fail to account for the nonlinear abundance-ecosystem\nfunctioning relationships observed in nature. Furthermore, under such\nnonlinearity no statistical scheme can be devised to partition the biodiversity\neffects.

A general\ncompartmental model is considered to describe the spread of an infectious\ndisease in a population distributed over several patches. For disconnected\nregions, many boundary equilibria may exist with mixed disease free and endemic\ncomponents, but these steady states usually disappear in the presence of\nspatial dispersal. However, if backward bifurcations can occur in the regions,\nsome partially endemic equilibria of the disconnected system move into the\ninterior of the nonnegative cone and persist with the introduction of mobility\nbetween the patches. We provide a mathematical procedure that precisely\ndescribes in terms of the local reproduction numbers and the connectivity\nnetwork of the patches, whether a steady state of the disconnected system is\npreserved or ceases to exist for low volumes of travel. Our results are\nillustrated on a patchy HIV transmission model with subthreshold endemic\nequilibria and backward bifurcation. We demonstrate the rich dynamical behavior\n(i.e., creation and destruction of steady states) and the presence of multiple\nstable endemic equilibria for various connection networks.",

In this scenario, the basic reproductive number $\\mathcal{R}^h_0$\nof the system where the reservoirs are not included could turn out to be less\nthan one, yet, an endemic equilibrium be observed. Indeed, when the reservoirs\nare taken back into account, the basic reproductive number $\\mathcal{R}_0^r$,\nof only vectors and reservoirs, explains the endemic state. Furthermore,\nreservoirs cycles with a small basic reproductive number could contribute to\nreach an endemic state in the human cycle. Therefore, when controlling for the\nspread of a disease, it could not be enough to focus on specific reservoir\ncycles or only on the vector. In this work, we created a simple epidemiological\nmodel with a network of reservoirs where $\\mathcal{R}_0^r$ is a bifurcation\nparameter of the system, explaining disease endemicity in the absence of a\nstrong reservoir cycle. This simple model may help to explain transmission\ndynamics of diseases such as Chagas, Leishmaniasis and Dengue.",

We show that the endemic\nequilibrium, if it exists, is asymptotically stable for any nontrivial initial\ncondition.

The main\ngeneral features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along\nwith the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of\nextinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral\nregion, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the\nwavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between\nextinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships\nprovide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction.\nSeveral strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the\nuncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the\nwavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR\nthrough the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction\nlaw varies with the parameter R = A(V)/E(B-V). These curves represent the true\nmonochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable\nfor dereddening IR--UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution, and can be\nused to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.",

The predator and prey\npopulations may coexist for a long time but ultimately both go extinct. In the\nfirst extinction route the predators go extinct first, whereas the prey thrive\nfor a long time and then also go extinct. In the second route the prey go\nextinct first causing a rapid extinction of the predators. Assuming large\nsub-population sizes in the coexistence state, we compare the probabilities of\neach of the two extinction routes and predict the most likely path of the\nsub-populations to extinction. We also suggest an effective three-state master\nequation for the probabilities to observe the coexistence state, the\npredator-free state and the empty state.",

                "description": "Given a branching random walk on a set $X$, we study its extinction\nprobability vectors $\\mathbf q(\\cdot,A)$. Their components are the probability\nthat the process goes extinct in a fixed $A\\subseteq X$, when starting from a\nvertex $x\\in X$. The set of extinction probability vectors (obtained letting\n$A$ vary among all subsets of $X$) is a subset of the set of the fixed points\nof the generating function of the branching random walk. In particular here we\nare interested in the cardinality of the set of extinction probability vectors.\nWe prove results which allow to understand whether the probability of\nextinction in a set $A$ is different from the one of extinction in another set\n$B$. In many cases there are only two possible extinction probability vectors\nand so far, in more complicated examples, only a finite number of distinct\nextinction probability vectors had been explicitly found. Whether a branching\nrandom walk could have an infinite number of distinct extinction probability\nvectors was not known. We apply our results to construct examples of branching\nrandom walks with uncountably many distinct extinction probability vectors.",

                "description": "Big languages such as English and Finnish have many natural language\nprocessing (NLP) resources and models, but this is not the case for\nlow-resourced and endangered languages as such resources are so scarce despite\nthe great advantages they would provide for the language communities. The most\ncommon types of resources available for low-resourced and endangered languages\nare translation dictionaries and universal dependencies. In this paper, we\npresent a method for constructing word embeddings for endangered languages\nusing existing word embeddings of different resource-rich languages and the\ntranslation dictionaries of resource-poor languages. Thereafter, the embeddings\nare fine-tuned using the sentences in the universal dependencies and aligned to\nmatch the semantic spaces of the big languages; resulting in cross-lingual\nembeddings. The endangered languages we work with here are Erzya, Moksha,\nKomi-Zyrian and Skolt Sami. Furthermore, we build a universal sentiment\nanalysis model for all the languages that are part of this study, whether\nendangered or not, by utilizing cross-lingual word embeddings. The evaluation\nconducted shows that our word embeddings for endangered languages are\nwell-aligned with the resource-rich languages, and they are suitable for\ntraining task-specific models as demonstrated by our sentiment analysis model\nwhich achieved a high accuracy. All our cross-lingual word embeddings and the\nsentiment analysis model have been released openly via an easy-to-use Python\nlibrary.",

Animals\nusually exhibit a wide range of variations on poses and there is no available\nanimal pose dataset for training and testing. To address this problem, we build\nan animal pose dataset to facilitate training and evaluation. Considering the\nheavy labor needed to label dataset and it is impossible to label data for all\nconcerned animal species, we, therefore, proposed a novel cross-domain\nadaptation method to transform the animal pose knowledge from labeled animal\nclasses to unlabeled animal classes. We use the modest animal pose dataset to\nadapt learned knowledge to multiple animals species. Moreover, humans also\nshare skeleton similarities with some animals (especially four-footed mammals).\nTherefore, the easily available human pose dataset, which is of a much larger\nscale than our labeled animal dataset, provides important prior knowledge to\nboost up the performance on animal pose estimation. Experiments show that our\nproposed method leverages these pieces of prior knowledge well and achieves\nconvincing results on animal pose estimation.",

To provide\nsimilar flexibility as other animation libraries, PaSe features extensibility\nof operations and inspectability of animations.

Based on AP-10K, we benchmark\nrepresentative pose estimation models on the following three tracks: (1)\nsupervised learning for animal pose estimation, (2) cross-domain transfer\nlearning from human pose estimation to animal pose estimation, and (3) intra-\nand inter-family domain generalization for unseen animals. The experimental\nresults provide sound empirical evidence on the superiority of learning from\ndiverse animals species in terms of both accuracy and generalization ability.\nIt opens new directions for facilitating future research in animal pose\nestimation.

I argue that this\nprinciple is neither an aesthetic nor a sociologically-influenced principle. I\ncontend that naturalness may only be plausibly argued to be an\naesthetic/sociological principle when formal measures of naturalness and their\nuse in physics communities are conflated with the central dogma of naturalness\n- the former may indeed be argued to be sociologically-influenced and somewhat\narbitrary - but these formal measures of naturalness are in fact less\nsuccessful than AoS naturalness. I put forward arguments as to why AoS\nnaturalness is well-defined and why it was reasonable for physicists to endorse\nthis naturalness principle on both theoretical and empirical grounds.\n  Up to date, no compelling reasons have appeared as to why the laws of nature\nshould generically decoupling into quasi-autonomous physical domains. A\ndecoupling of scales in the quantum realm is often claimed to be entailed by\nthe Decoupling Theorem (Cao and Schweber (1993)), yet I will show that this\ntheorem is too weak to underwrite quasi-autonomous physical domains in quantum\nfield theories because one should additionally impose that parameters be\nnatural. Violations of naturalness would then have ontological import -\nunnatural parameters would not be accurately described by EFTs but rather by\nfield theories exhibiting some kind of UV/IR interplay.",
