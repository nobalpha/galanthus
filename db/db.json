        "description": "We view Digital Ecosystems to be the digital counterparts of biological\necosystems. Here, we are concerned with the creation of these Digital\nEcosystems, exploiting the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems\nto evolve high-level software applications. Therefore, we created the Digital\nEcosystem, a novel optimisation technique inspired by biological ecosystems,\nwhere the optimisation works at two levels: a first optimisation, migration of\nagents which are distributed in a decentralised peer-to-peer network, operating\ncontinuously in time; this process feeds a second optimisation based on\nevolutionary computing that operates locally on single peers and is aimed at\nfinding solutions to satisfy locally relevant constraints. The Digital\nEcosystem was then measured experimentally through simulations, with measures\noriginating from theoretical ecology, evaluating its likeness to biological\necosystems. This included its responsiveness to requests for applications from\nthe user base, as a measure of the ecological succession (ecosystem maturity).\nOverall, we have advanced the understanding of Digital Ecosystems, creating\nEcosystem-Oriented Architectures where the word ecosystem is more than just a\nmetaphor.",

        "description": "Much research that analyzes the evolution of a software ecosystem is confined\nto its own boundaries. Evidence shows, however, that software ecosystems\nco-evolve independently with other software ecosystems. In other words,\nunderstanding the evolution of a software ecosystem requires an especially\nastute awareness of its competitive landscape and much consideration for other\nsoftware ecosystems in related markets. A software ecosystem does not evolve in\ninsulation but with other software ecosystems. In this research, we analyzed\nthe OpenStack software ecosystem with a focal perspective that attempted to\nunderstand its evolution as a function of other software ecosystems. We\nattempted to understand and explain the evolution of OpenStack in relation to\nother software ecosystems in the cloud computing market. Our findings add to\ntheoretical knowledge in software ecosystems by identifying and discussing\nseven different mechanisms by which software ecosystems mutually influence each\nother: sedimentation and embeddedness of business relationships, strategic\nmanagement of the portfolio of business relationships, firms values and\nreputation as a partner, core technological architecture, design of the APIs,\ncompetitive replication of functionality and multi-homing. Research addressing\nthe evolution of software ecosystem should, therefore, acknowledge that\nsoftware ecosystems entangle with other software ecosystems in multiple ways,\neven with competing ones. A rigorous analysis of the evolution of a software\necosystem should not be solely confined to its inner boundaries.",

        "description": "Resolving the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has\nbeen one of the central goals of modern ecology. Early debates about the\nrelationship were finally resolved with the advent of a statistical\npartitioning scheme that decomposed the biodiversity effect into a \"selection\"\neffect and a \"complementarity\" effect. We prove that both the biodiversity\neffect and its statistical decomposition into selection and complementarity are\nfundamentally flawed because these methods use a na\\\"ive null expectation based\non neutrality, likely leading to an overestimate of the net biodiversity\neffect, and they fail to account for the nonlinear abundance-ecosystem\nfunctioning relationships observed in nature. Furthermore, under such\nnonlinearity no statistical scheme can be devised to partition the biodiversity\neffects. We also present an alternative metric providing a more reasonable\nestimate of biodiversity effect. Our results suggest that all studies conducted\nsince the early 1990s likely overestimated the positive effects of biodiversity\non ecosystem functioning.",

        "description": "The magnitude and variability of Earth's biodiversity have puzzled scientists\never since paleontologic fossil databases became available. We identify and\nstudy a model of interdependent species where both endogenous and exogenous\nimpacts determine the nonstationary extinction dynamics. The framework provides\nan explanation for the qualitative difference of marine and continental\nbiodiversity growth. In particular, the stagnation of marine biodiversity may\nresult from a global transition from an imbalanced to a balanced state of the\nspecies dependency network. The predictions of our framework are in agreement\nwith paleontologic databases.",

A threshold quantity is found that controls the\nstability of the disease-free equilibrium and guarantees the existence of an\nendemic equilibrium. We obtain conditions on the age-dependence of the\nsusceptibility to infection that imply the uniqueness of the endemic\nequilibrium. An example with two endemic equilibria is shown. Finally, we\nanalyse numerically how the stability of the endemic equilibrium is affected by\nextra-mortality and by the possible periodicities induced by the demographic\nage-structure.",

        "title": "Large number of endemic equilibria for disease transmission models in\n  patchy environment",
        "description": "We show that disease transmission models in a spatially heterogeneous\nenvironment can have a large number of coexisting endemic equilibria. A general\ncompartmental model is considered to describe the spread of an infectious\ndisease in a population distributed over several patches. For disconnected\nregions, many boundary equilibria may exist with mixed disease free and endemic\ncomponents, but these steady states usually disappear in the presence of\nspatial dispersal. However, if backward bifurcations can occur in the regions,\nsome partially endemic equilibria of the disconnected system move into the\ninterior of the nonnegative cone and persist with the introduction of mobility\nbetween the patches. We provide a mathematical procedure that precisely\ndescribes in terms of the local reproduction numbers and the connectivity\nnetwork of the patches, whether a steady state of the disconnected system is\npreserved or ceases to exist for low volumes of travel. Our results are\nillustrated on a patchy HIV transmission model with subthreshold endemic\nequilibria and backward bifurcation. We demonstrate the rich dynamical behavior\n(i.e., creation and destruction of steady states) and the presence of multiple\nstable endemic equilibria for various connection networks.",

        "title": "Correcting for the Effects of Interstellar Extinction",
        "description": "This paper addresses the issue of how best to correct astronomical data for\nthe wavelength-dependent effects of Galactic interstellar extinction. The main\ngeneral features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along\nwith the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of\nextinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral\nregion, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the\nwavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between\nextinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships\nprovide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction.\nSeveral strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the\nuncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the\nwavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR\nthrough the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction\nlaw varies with the parameter R = A(V)/E(B-V). These curves represent the true\nmonochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable\nfor dereddening IR--UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution, and can be\nused to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.",

        "title": "Multiple extinction routes in stochastic population models",
        "description": "Isolated populations ultimately go extinct because of the intrinsic noise of\nelementary processes. In multi-population systems extinction of a population\nmay occur via more than one route. We investigate this generic situation in a\nsimple predator-prey (or infected-susceptible) model. The predator and prey\npopulations may coexist for a long time but ultimately both go extinct. In the\nfirst extinction route the predators go extinct first, whereas the prey thrive\nfor a long time and then also go extinct. In the second route the prey go\nextinct first causing a rapid extinction of the predators. Assuming large\nsub-population sizes in the coexistence state, we compare the probabilities of\neach of the two extinction routes and predict the most likely path of the\nsub-populations to extinction. We also suggest an effective three-state master\nequation for the probabilities to observe the coexistence state, the\npredator-free state and the empty state.",

Animals\nusually exhibit a wide range of variations on poses and there is no available\nanimal pose dataset for training and testing. To address this problem, we build\nan animal pose dataset to facilitate training and evaluation. Considering the\nheavy labor needed to label dataset and it is impossible to label data for all\nconcerned animal species, we, therefore, proposed a novel cross-domain\nadaptation method to transform the animal pose knowledge from labeled animal\nclasses to unlabeled animal classes. We use the modest animal pose dataset to\nadapt learned knowledge to multiple animals species. Moreover, humans also\nshare skeleton similarities with some animals (especially four-footed mammals).\nTherefore, the easily available human pose dataset, which is of a much larger\nscale than our labeled animal dataset, provides important prior knowledge to\nboost up the performance on animal pose estimation. Experiments show that our\nproposed method leverages these pieces of prior knowledge well and achieves\nconvincing results on animal pose estimation.",

To provide\nsimilar flexibility as other animation libraries, PaSe features extensibility\nof operations and inspectability of animations. We present the features of PaSe\nwith a to-do list application, discuss the PaSe implementation, and argue that\nthe callback style of extensibility is detrimental for correctly combining PaSe\nfeatures.

        "title": "Naturalness as a reasonable scientific principle in fundamental physics",
        "description": "I aim to clarify the physical content and significance of naturalness.\nPhysicists' earliest understanding of naturalness, as an autonomy of scales\n(AoS) requirement provides the most cogent definition of naturalness and I will\nassert that i) this provides a uniform notion which undergirds a myriad\nprominent naturalness conditions, ii) this is a reasonable criterion to impose\non EFTs and iii) the successes and violations of naturalness are best\nunderstood when adhering to this notion of naturalness. I argue that this\nprinciple is neither an aesthetic nor a sociologically-influenced principle. I\ncontend that naturalness may only be plausibly argued to be an\naesthetic/sociological principle when formal measures of naturalness and their\nuse in physics communities are conflated with the central dogma of naturalness\n- the former may indeed be argued to be sociologically-influenced and somewhat\narbitrary - but these formal measures of naturalness are in fact less\nsuccessful than AoS naturalness. I put forward arguments as to why AoS\nnaturalness is well-defined and why it was reasonable for physicists to endorse\nthis naturalness principle on both theoretical and empirical grounds.\n  Up to date, no compelling reasons have appeared as to why the laws of nature\nshould generically decoupling into quasi-autonomous physical domains. A\ndecoupling of scales in the quantum realm is often claimed to be entailed by\nthe Decoupling Theorem (Cao and Schweber (1993)), yet I will show that this\ntheorem is too weak to underwrite quasi-autonomous physical domains in quantum\nfield theories because one should additionally impose that parameters be\nnatural. Violations of naturalness would then have ontological import -\nunnatural parameters would not be accurately described by EFTs but rather by\nfield theories exhibiting some kind of UV/IR interplay.",
